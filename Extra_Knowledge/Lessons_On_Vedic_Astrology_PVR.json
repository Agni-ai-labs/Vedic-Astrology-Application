Savitri\nWe are very happy to present this work for the rest of the Hingorani of Sadhu Vaswani Center, Dracut, Massachusetts, USA\nVedic Astrology student community. We the students of SJC-Boston for giving us the premises free of cost for conducting the astrology\ngroup are very fortunate to have a Jyotish Guru like Sri. PVR classes.\nNarasimha Rao, teach us the concepts in Vedic Astrology from\nground zero. We have been maintaining the mp3 audio of these Any mistakes in this book are totally on that part of us, the\nlessons at http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net we hope this book to students and will rectify them in due course.\nsupplement the mp3 audio.\nSuddenly we realized that when we wanted to go back and\nlisten to a particular concept, it has been very difficult to track where Students of Narasimha\nthat concept was talked about and in which lesson. So, it was an SJC-Boston\nidea to provide a summary of each class highlighting the topics 21 July 2005.\ncovered and the keynotes for each of the classes. That is the\npurpose of this book. A different student summarized each lesson\nand we tried to keep the overall format of the structure very similar.\nBut, there would be some differences in the presentation due to\nindividual’s style of writing.\nEach of the classes has several important concepts covered,\nexamples solved along with key points in astrology that were\nrelevant to the topic of discussion but, not really part of the concept\nthat was being talked about. The intention was to capture all those\npoints under “key points” section. In most cases other than the\nobvious the name of the person in the example charts is left out in\nthis book so that, the listener of the audio will not be biased while\nanalyzing the chart. In this volume we are capturing all lessons from\n1 through 45 which were taught between 6 May 2004 and 12 June\n2005. Appendix “A” highlights all the abbreviations used in this book.\nAppendix “B” is gives quick reference of all the lessons with example\nchart’s data.\nWe are extremely thankful to Sri. P.V.R. Narasimha Rao for\nteaching the classes to benefit all astrology students.\nWe are thankful to Pt. Sanjay Rath for the astrology\nconferences and allowing us to associate with Sri Jagannath Center\nfor learning of Vedic Astrology.\nWe are extremely thankful to Sri.Narayan Iyer of Sri\nJagannath Center for readily accepting our request to provide the\nguidance in putting together this material.\nOur thanks to Master Manasvi Putcha and to Sri.Vijay Chitra\nfor the graphics on the cover design and the Audio CD preparation.\nxi xii\nCONTENTS Appendix A: Glossary:...................................................212\nLesson #1.............................................................................1 Appendix B: Quick Reference........................................214\nLesson #2.............................................................................4\nLesson #3...........................................................................10\nLesson #4...........................................................................13\nLesson #5...........................................................................16\nLesson #6...........................................................................23\nLesson #7...........................................................................32\nLesson #8...........................................................................37\nLesson #9...........................................................................42\nLesson #10.........................................................................46\nLesson #11.........................................................................50\nLesson #12.........................................................................55\nLesson #13.........................................................................60\nLesson #14.........................................................................63\nLesson #15.........................................................................65\nLesson #16.........................................................................68\nLesson #17.........................................................................71\nLesson #18.........................................................................76\nLesson #19.........................................................................80\nLesson #20.........................................................................82\nLesson #21.........................................................................89\nLesson #22.........................................................................96\nLesson #23.......................................................................100\nLesson #24.......................................................................103\nLesson #25.......................................................................107\nLesson #26.......................................................................111\nLesson #27.......................................................................122\nLesson #28.......................................................................132\nLesson #29.......................................................................134\nLesson #30.......................................................................136\nLesson #31.......................................................................138\nLesson #32.......................................................................140\nLesson #33.......................................................................146\nLesson #34.......................................................................153\nLesson #35.......................................................................157\nLesson #36.......................................................................163\nLesson #37.......................................................................170\nLesson #38.......................................................................172\nLesson #39.......................................................................174\nLesson #40.......................................................................183\nLesson #41.......................................................................186\nLesson #42.......................................................................192\nLesson #43.......................................................................196\nLesson #44.......................................................................200\nLesson #45.......................................................................204\n2 Lessons on Vedic Astrology\nLesson #1 9.

Weekdays, Sunday (Su), Monday (Mo), Tuesday (Ma),\nWednesday (Me), Thursday (Ju), Friday (Ve), Saturday (Sa).\nb. What is the logic behind this order? ->HORA is the reason,\nthere are 24 horas. First hora of the day starts at sunrise.\n2. Brahma Gayatri (sunrise), Vishnu’s or Achyuta’s time (noon),\nSiva gayatri (sunset), Kali gayatri (not auspicious).\n3. Distance from sun, speed w.r.t. to earth, the rule used for\nallocating houses to planets. (Sa is slowest).\n4. Hindus consider 1day starting from one Sunrise to the next.\n5. Astronomical fact is, Sa is slowest (takes 2.5yrs to move one\nsign, or 30yrs), Ju (takes 1yrs to move one rasi OR 12 yrs), Ma\n(1.5yrs), Su (1yr), Ve and Me and Mo - This is the order.\n6. For Saturday, the horas starting with Sa will be Sa, Ju, Ma, Su,\nVe, Me. Mo. This makes one cycle of 7 hours, so for one day (of\n24hrs or horas), there will be three cycles followed by (24-21=3\nhoras of) Sa, Ju, Ma - Next day begins with Sun's HORA\n(Hence, the day after Saturday is Sunday) and so and so forth.\n7. This is what Narasimha knows about an explanation for a Day\nconsisting 24horas -> 12 rasis - one for day and one for night,\nhence, there are 24 hours. HORA is taken from AHORATRA,\nAHO is Day, and RATRA is night.\n8. Four houses are considered base of Purusharthas. 1, 10, 7 and\n4 are bases of the DHARMA, ARTHA, KAMA and MOKSHA\npurusharthas.\n9. DIGBALA - how close a planet is close to the base? (one of the\nstrengths relate to a planet).\n10. Me and Ju are planets of dharma, Sa is planet of Kama, Su and\nMa are planets of Artha and Mo and Ve are planets of Moksha\ndepending on how far away they are to a base, they are\naccordingly given strength. This planet association is used to\ncompute “shadbalas” other strengths, which will be detailed in\nfuture classes.\n11. Civil Calendar is Sun’s calendar.\n12.

Arudha Padas are often mistaken to be Jaimini Astrology (Refer\nJaimini Upadesas Sutras by Pt Sanjay Rath). Parasara has\ntalked about them too (Refer BPHS). It may be noted that\nJaimini has written in depth about the subject.\n3. The actual houses, for example, 5th house of abilities does not\nreally show the measurable or perceivable aspect of the ability.\nWhereas an award marks in an examination, trophies are\nperceivable.\n4. Arudha means a “risen one”. Arudha Pada is the risen aspect –\nthe perceivable aspect of any given house. It is the tangible\naspect of a given house.\n5. Arudha of the 5th house is represented by “A5” (Refer JHORA 7)\nand so on.\n6. The analogy is, the actual house is like an object, the lord of the\nhouse is like a mirror and the Arudha is the image of object in\nthe mirror (lord). From any house, find the distance from that\nhouse to its lord and Arudha of that house is the same distance\nfrom the house containing the lord.\n7.

Predictions about his release.\nKey Points:\nRules to see if a person is a saint:\n1. 3rd house is the house of initiative and drive and 6th house is the\nhouse of defeating enemies. If naturally benefic planets such as\nJupiter, Venus, Me etc., are in 3rd & 6th from AL, the person\ndoes not want to fight and he is not inclined materially. He is\nvery gentle and restrained in public behavior. This combination\nis generally present in the charts of saints and mild natured\npeople.\n2. Malefic planets in the 3rd and 6th houses from AL are good for\nmaterially successful persons like politicians or businessmen.\nThese people are perceived as bold and who hit enemies hard.\nIf there are no planets in those houses, the nature of the signs\n(malefic or benefic) and the lords of the signs will give the\nresults. The sign aspect on these houses will give the secondary\nresults. See if there are any benefic or malefic planets in those\nsigns.\n3. If Ma is in the 3rd and Ju is in the 6th from AL, that person’s first\ninstinct is to hurt his enemy, but he won’t. If Ju is in the 3rd and\nMa is in the 6th, that person does not have the initiative to fight,\nbut once he decides to fight he will finish the enemy.\n4. For the matters of Dharma and marriage Su behaves like a\nbenefic, especially if he is in a friend’s sign.\nMoola dasa and Vimsottari dasas:\n5. To find when the results of various past life karmas are\nmanifested in this life, look at the Moola dasa. This dasa shows\nthe root of events from our past life.\n6. In a saint’s chart, the 9th house and the karma the 9th lord carries\nis very important. For example if the lord of 9th house is in Deva\n(divine) Shashtyamsa, a high level of dharma will be granted to\nthat person. And if the ninth lord is in Rakshasa Shashtyamsa\nthe dharma that person follows is defined by a lot of negative\nLesson #22 97 98 Lessons on Vedic Astrology\nYoga (Lunisolar day) and Karana (half of a lunar day).

Shiva governs the 7th house. Narayana is\neither with Brahma (Lagna) or with Shiva (7th house).\n3. Choosing where to start the ND is based on the following:\na. more planets in that sign (ASC or 7th)\nb. Ju, Me, or the lord of the sign aspects (in ND, use only\nrasi aspects).\nc. Exalted planets in that house.\nd. Oddity of the sign and lord. If both are different, that\nwins.\ne. Look at the degrees occupied by the lord of the sign.\nThe more the better.\n4. For further progressions, follow the order below.\na. For a movable sign (Brahma) follow regular order. (i.e.\nnext sign, next to next sign etc..).\nb. For fixed signs (Shiva) take the 6th from that sign.\nc. For a dual sign (Vishnu), go by 1, 5, 9 (dharma trikonas),\nthen 10, 2, 6 (artha trikonas) then 7, 1, 3 (kama\ntrikonas).\n5.

Question: Does there have to be Ra/Ke in the 9H for foreign trip\nto happen during the period of the Narayana Dasa of the 9H\nsign?\nAns: Not necessarily. The involvement of 9H or 12H and\ntheir lords with Ra/Ke is suffice. Ra is the karaka for the project of\nforeign travel. The house, say 9H, represents the project, the planet\nin the 9H represents the persons working in the project, the 9th lord is\nthe manager of these persons. If the karaka (Ra) has sufficient\ncontrol, or if the karaka is a good friend of the people-manager, then\nthe project will be done successfully. This is true in Rasi and also in\nD-4.\nPuzzle Chart:\n2. In D-10, 10H (Career) is empty. 10L Ve is weak being with\nenemy Ju, but forms Raja yoga as Ju is 5L.

This shows that in Key Points:\neach areas of the life, there are different influences, which may Example Chart 1 and explanation of Rule\nalso change with respect to time. 1. Ar is the present Narayana Dasa of the Rasi Chart. Ar is in 8H.\nHence, during this dasa, 8H results can be given. Lord of Ar is\nMa which is 3L as well. Hence, during this dasa, 3H results can\nalso be given. Lord of Ar is 8H, hence in this case 8H results (i.e.\nthe result of the house containing the Dasa Lord) again may also\nbe given. If there are planets, which are aspecting the Dasa rasi,\nthey can also give their results during the period. Hence, several\nresults are possible in Ar dasa itself.\n2. Also for example, if Le is the running dasa, then 12H results can\nbe given as Le is in the 12H. Additional results that are possible\nare: 10H (as Le is 10th from AL), 7H (as its Lord Su is in 7H),\nresult of Ke, result of 3H (as 3L is Ke), results of Ju, Ve, Ma, Me\nand Sa (as they aspect Le by rasi drishti). Thus again a number\nof results can occur in Le dasa. There are clear rules to find out\nwhich result is experienced in which part of the dasa.\n3. To prove the point further, Cn is the second dasa and is in the\n11H. Hence during this dasa, there could have been gains. As\n11L Mo is aspecting it by rasi drishti, there may be some gains\nrelated to food business or nursing business (Mo significations).\nAgain, Mo is in the 6H of enmity and also afflicted by Ra. Hence\nsome enmity may also be experienced. Whether the enmity is\nrelated to gains is a different issue, but the fact that there is a\npossibility of enmity is clear. Suppose, the 4 L or 7L Ju is placed\nin Cn, there could be gain related to 4H and 7H (home/car/wife\netc) or relationship with the spouse may be harmonious (as Ju in\nCn would be exalted).\n4.

We look at the moon as the ASC to judge\nhow the mind of the person is. To see what the level of energy or\ndrive is, we look at mars as the LA. To look at the wisdom or\nintelligence we use Ju as the LA. For sense pleasures and\nhappiness we look at Ve as the LA. The philosophy of Astakavarga\nis based on this principle. If you want to see the hard work and\ndiscipline the person will have then look at Sa as the LA. Look at the\nownership, occupancy, avastha.\nFor example if Ju is the 8th lord in the 8th house we first see what\nplanet it is and then its agenda and how is it disposed. The ASC\nstands for the sum total of your being. So if you take Ju as ASC here\nthe first thing you see is that Ju is well placed in its own house, then\nlook at how the other planets are in relation to Ju in the 8th house as\nthe LA. See if the planets are helping or hurting Ju and its agenda.\nJu in the 8th is a good yoga in its own house. The agenda is the 8th\nhouse so all the positive aspects of the 8th house (sudden\ndevelopments in life, beneficial changes) will come into play.

This chart is presented with 10 minute uncertainty. Discussed\nbelow is GMT and Local Mean time.\n2. Every place had its own time before the standard time came into\nvogue. In JHORA, If you use LMT instead automatically, it will\nmake Time Zone 0 basically making it mutually exclusive.\n3. Reason, Look at the Longitude, 2 W 13 minutes of GMT. Apply 4\nminutes for every degree...13minutes can be approximated to\n1/4 degree(15minutes). Therefore, LMT will be off from standard\ntime by 2.25 degrees*4 = roughly 9minutes.\n4. Basically, 20:16 LMT and 20:25 GMT are one and the same.\nYou can verify this using Jhora with and without checking \"Use\nLMT instead\". There is a small error, however.\n5. Its not that one is more accurate than the other. If your watch\nwas set to LMT or GMT, you should enter the time accordingly in\nJHora.If you were to accurately find the LMT, it comes to 20:15:8\nand this was approximated to 20:16. Both these times have the\nsame ASC.\n6. Usually people use clock time, based on a particular TZ,\nstandard time. Radio time is found for the particular line that\ngoes through. Radios/TVs stick to standard time. Old charts\nwere calibrating it for the LMT, as far as they are concerned,\nthey are at a fixed point.\n7. Tricky only when you look at old charts. Somebody may have\nconverted standard to LMT or vice versa, you need to ask that\nperson.
